## About the Pet Project

Through this project, I improved my React skills by working with state management, optimizing component reusability, and handling complex user interactions.

This project was also an opportunity to further develop my JavaScript skills, particularly in managing state, handling user interactions, and implementing UI components.

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a practice project (pet project) designed as a platform for purchasing courses and connecting with mentors. The project is built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Redux, and React Router, incorporating various interactive elements to enhance the user experience.
